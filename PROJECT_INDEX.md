## Architecture Summary

The TTS Audio Suite follows a **unified modular architecture** where:

1. **Engine Nodes** (`nodes/engines/`) provide user configuration interfaces
2. **Unified Nodes** (`nodes/unified/`) offer consistent user experience across all engines  
3. **Engine Implementations** (`engines/`) handle the actual TTS/VC processing
4. **Adapters** (`engines/adapters/`) bridge engines to the unified interface
5. **Utilities** (`utils/`) provide shared functionality across all components
6. **Web Interface** (`web/`) enables interactive features like audio analysis

This design allows easy addition of new engines while maintaining a consistent user experience and shared optimization features across all TTS engines.
