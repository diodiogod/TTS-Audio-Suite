# TTS Audio Suite - Universal TTS for ComfyUI
# Comprehensive multi-engine TTS with Python 3.13 compatibility

# --- INSTALLATION METHOD ---
# This custom node uses install.py for intelligent dependency management.
# ComfyUI Manager automatically runs install.py which handles:
# - Python 3.13 compatibility issues (MediaPipe → OpenSeeFace fallback)
# - NumPy version conflicts (constraints to avoid Numba issues)
# - Package dependency conflicts (selective --no-deps installation)
# - All bundled engines: ChatterBox, F5-TTS, Higgs Audio
# - Optional features: RVC voice conversion, mouth movement analysis

# --- CORE SAFE PACKAGES ---
# These packages rarely cause conflicts and install normally

# Foundation ML packages

# --- PROBLEMATIC PACKAGES ---
# These are installed by install.py with special handling:
# - librosa (--no-deps): Forces numpy downgrade
# - descript-audio-codec (--no-deps): Conflicts with protobuf
# - cached-path (--no-deps): Forces package downgrades  
# - torchcrepe (--no-deps): Conflicts via librosa dependency
# - onnxruntime (--no-deps): Forces numpy 2.3.x, needed for OpenSeeFace

# --- PYTHON 3.13 NOTES ---
# ✅ All TTS engines work (ChatterBox, F5-TTS, Higgs Audio)
# ✅ RVC voice conversion works
# ✅ OpenSeeFace mouth movement (experimental alternative)
# ❌ MediaPipe incompatible (binary compatibility issue)

# --- BUNDLED ENGINES ---
# All engines are bundled to avoid external dependency conflicts:
# - ChatterBox: engines/chatterbox/ (modified for ComfyUI)
# - F5-TTS: engines/f5_tts/ (numpy 2.x compatible fork)
# - Higgs Audio: engines/higgs_audio/ (transformers 4.46+ compatible)
