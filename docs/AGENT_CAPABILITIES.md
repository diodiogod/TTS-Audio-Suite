# Jules - Agent Capabilities for TTS Audio Suite

I am Jules, an AI software engineer. I can assist you with various tasks related to the `TTS-Audio-Suite` project.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Codebase Navigation and Understanding
I can explore and understand the structure of this ComfyUI extension.
- **Node Logic**: I understand how nodes are defined in `nodes.py` and how they interact with ComfyUI.
- **Engine Adapters**: I can navigate the `engines/` directory (e.g., `engines/chatterbox_engine_node.py`, `engines/f5tts_engine_node.py`) to understand how different TTS engines are integrated.
- **Utility Modules**: I can analyze helper functions in `utils/` for audio processing, file handling, and compatibility.

### 2. Bug Fixing and Debugging
I can help identify and resolve issues in the code.
- **Error Analysis**: If you provide error logs, I can trace them back to the source code.
- **Logic Errors**: I can spot logical flaws in audio processing or node execution flows.
- **Compatibility**: I can help resolve issues related to Python versions (like 3.13 compatibility mentioned in `README.md`) or dependency conflicts.

### 3. Feature Implementation
I can assist in adding new features to the suite.
- **New Engines**: I can help integrate new TTS engines by creating new engine nodes following the existing patterns.
- **New Features**: I can implement new functionality like improved text chunking, new audio filters, or enhanced UI widgets.
- **Refactoring**: I can help improve code quality and maintainability, such as the "Universal Streaming Architecture".

### 4. Testing and Quality Assurance
I can ensure the stability of the project.
- **Unit Tests**: I can write and run unit tests in `tests/unit/` to verify specific functions.
- **Integration Tests**: I can help structure integration tests in `tests/integration/` to ensure nodes work correctly within the ComfyUI ecosystem.
- **Test Execution**: I can run the test suite using `pytest` to catch regressions.

### 5. Documentation
I can help keep documentation up-to-date.
- **README Updates**: I can update `README.md` with new features or installation instructions.
- **Technical Guides**: I can create developer reports or implementation guides in `docs/`.

## How to Work with Me
- **Ask Questions**: Ask me how specific parts of the code work.
- **Assign Tasks**: Give me specific coding tasks, like "Add a parameter to the F5-TTS node" or "Fix the bug in the SRT parser".
- **Request Reviews**: Ask me to review code or plans before implementation.

I am here to help you build a better TTS experience for ComfyUI!
